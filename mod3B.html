                            and passengers. Seat belts are crucial for preventing serious injuries and fatalities in the
                            event of a collision. Child restraint laws stipulate the use of appropriate child safety
                            seats or restraints based on the age, weight, and height of children. These laws aim to
                            protect young passengers and ensure their safety while traveling in a vehicle.

                            Legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits are established, and exceeding these limits
                            is considered a criminal offense. Penalties for impaired driving can include fines, license
                            suspension, mandatory alcohol education programs, community service, probation, and even
                            imprisonment. These laws aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and fatalities caused by
                            impaired driving, promoting the safety of all road users.

                            sharing the road, respecting their rights, and providing them with adequate space. For
                            example, drivers are required to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, maintain a safe
                            distance when passing cyclists, and be attentive to motorcyclists' presence on the road.
                            These measures aim to reduce accidents and promote the safety of vulnerable road users who

                        <p>In Texas, the Health and Safety Code permits drivers to make an anatomical gift and donate an
                            organ upon death. When a driver decides to authorize an anatomical gift, he becomes a donor
                            in case of a fatal crash accident. In this case, all or some parts of the body organs will
                            be donated for transplant, scientific study, research, therapy, or education.

                            Donors are, in a way, lifesavers who give hope to those in need of body organs. Those who
                            wait for an organ donation often wait for weeks, months, or even years before getting a

        <h2>Litter Prevention
        </h2>
        <p>
            While litter may seem commonplace and negligible, in Texas it is a serious issue. In 2013, Texas Department
            of Transportation estimated that 1.5 billion pieces of litter left behind on Texas roads needed addressing.
            The year prior in 2012, the department spent $47 million just to clean up the roads.
        </p>
        <p>Amazingly, 31% of these are cigarette butts that may even increase the risk of wildfires. Drivers caught
            littering in Texas roads may suffer the following consequences, depending on the weight of the trash:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Litter weighing up to 5 pounds – Class C misdemeanor with $ 500 fine
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighing between 5 to 500 pounds – Class B misdemeanor with fine of up to $2,000 and / or as many as 180
                days in jail
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighing between 500 to 1,000 pounds – Class A misdemeanor with fine of up to $4,000
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            On top of these, community service may also be required for those caught in the act of littering.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>
            Compulsary Insurance
        </h2>

        <p>Texas requires that all drivers insure their vehicles under the 30 / 60 / 25 rule of thumb coverage. This
            rule applies to the minimum insurance coverage that each driver must have in line with Texas laws.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>$30,000 per injured person and minimum of $60,000 per accident
            </li>
            <li>$25,000 insurance for property damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While proof of insurance is adequate for drivers without violations, Texas requires SR-22 or Certificate of
            Financial Responsibility if it is court-ordered or required by the Department of Public Safety.
            <br>
            Drivers who were involved in a car crash are required to file their SR-22 certificate with the Department of
            Public Safety. Likewise, those who are cited twice for driving without insurance will be asked by Texas to
            file an SR-22.

        <h2>Interaction with Law Enforcement
        </h2>
        <p>When asked by an officer to stop, promptly respond to give the officer time to carry out his task. Remain
            calm, follow instructions, and communicate honestly. Be ready to present your documents and identification.
            For a smooth interaction, these are do’s and don’ts when in a traffic stop with a police officer:
        </p>
        <p>While being stopped by an officer, you should do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promptly reduce speed and pull over to the right side of the road as soon as it is safe to do so.
            </li>
            <li>Park your vehicle on the right shoulder safely. If this is not possible, choose the safest area nearby
                with low traffic.
            </li>
            <li>In conditions where there is low light or poor visibility, switch your hazard lights on.
            </li>
            <li>
                For safety, an officer may opt to approach from the right side of your vehicle
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do the following while your vehicle remains parked: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use your emergency brake and park mode, then switch off the engine.
            </li>
            <li>The officer should be able to see your hands on the steering wheel, while the hands of passengers should
                be visible as well.
            </li>
            <li>Lower your window—failure to do so is illegal. </li>
            <li>Communicate openly with the officer. Before attempting to reach for documents or your license, notify
                the officer of where you will get them. If there is a firearm inside your vehicle, let the officer know.
                Your required documents should be located separately from the firearm.
            </li>
            <li>Listen carefully and follow the officer’s instructions. When the officer approaches your vehicle,
                movements such as reaching for or searching for required documents, may be seen as performing something
                illegal.
            </li>
            <li>Remain inside the vehicle unless you are instructed to exit the car. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are what you should not do in your interaction with an officer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reach or search for documents of license even before or while the officer approaches your car
            </li>
            <li>Attempt to leave a traffic stop while the officer is still carrying out his procedure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you suspect that the vehicle calling your attention is not a police officer, drive slowly towards a
            populated area and call 9-1-1. You may wait for the officer to be identified before ending the call.

            Child Passenger Restraint System
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Texas, the law requires the use of seat belts. For children, the appropriate seat belts must be used so
            they can remain safe in the vehicle. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines, and of course, an added
            risk in case of collision.
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to their size kids have to wear customizes seat belts fit for their height. Various options in the
            market make it easier for them to get accustomed to wearing seat belts as well until they are tall enough to
            wear the built-in seat belts. If you are transporting your kids in your vehicle, check out the various
            age-appropriate child restraint systems that they can wear.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Rear-facing seats (birth to 12 months)
            </strong>
            From birth to 12 months, rear-facing seats are appropriate to transport your kids in your car. Choose the
            ones with higher weight and height limits so you can use it for much longer for your child. Rear-facing
            seats are the only option for infants when carrying them in your car.
            <br>
            For as long as your kid remains comfortable and tethered appropriately, you can use a rear-facing seat until
            the age of 3. When necessary, upgrade to a forward-facing seat so your kid can remain comfortable when
            seated in the car.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Forward-facing seats (1 – 3 and 4 – 7 years old)
            </strong>
            Similar to rear-facing seats, choose the one with the highest weight and height limits. You may use
            forward-facing seats for your kid until the age of 7, provided that he or she is still within the prescribed
            limits.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Booster seat (4 – 7 and 8 – 12 years old)
            </strong>
            Booster seats are the last child restraint system your kid can occupy until he or she finally reaches the
            height of a young teen. Until your kid is taller than 4 feet and 9 inches, remaining on the booster seat is
            the safe option.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are several products in the market, make sure the one you are buying is approved by federal
            standards. Traveling with the peace of mind that your kids are safely restrained frees you up to focus on
            driving.

        <h2>Leaving Children in the Car</h2>
        <p>A vehicle left under the intense sun is going to heat like an oven. If you have a child with you in the car,
            do not leave your child alone while your vehicle is parked. When the temperature heats up, the child can
            suffer hyperthermia or heat stroke that can permanently damage internal organs such as brain, liver, and
            kidney. In extreme cases, heat stroke may lead to death. </p>
        <p>
            In Texas, leaving a child younger than 7 years old alone in the car, without a guardian of at least 14 years
            of age, is a crime.
            <br>
            <br>

            It is an offense classified as a Class C misdemeanor and a crime punishable under the Texas Penal Code.

            Human Trafficking Prevention (SB 1831)
        </h2>
        <p>
            According to a report in 2016, 300,000 Texans are victims of trafficking and around 79,000 of them are
            children. The government of Texas is serious in clamping down on this menace, encouraging civil society to
            work together with the state in bringing down these lawless elements and taking them to justice.
        </p>
        <p>As a citizen of the state, you can contribute by knowing the red flags of human trafficking. The Attorney
            General of the state lists down some of the indicators of a victim of sex trafficking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person seems overly fearful, submissive, tense, or paranoid.
            </li>
            <li>Person defers to another person before giving information.
            </li>
            <li>Person has physical injuries or branding such as name tattoos on face or chest, tattoos about money and
                sex, or pimp phrases.
            </li>
            <li>Wears clothing that is inappropriately sexual or inappropriate for weather.
            </li>
            <li>Minor is unaccompanied at night or cannot explain who they are with and what they are doing.
            </li>
            <li>They do not possess identification documents because they are held by another person.
            </li>
            <li>Person works long or excessive hours or is always available “on demand.”
            </li>
            <li>Overly sexual for age or situation.
            </li>
            <li>The person has multiple phones or social media accounts.
            </li>
            <li>Signs of unusual and unexplained wealth—new jewelry, shoes, phones without any known form of income.
            </li>
            <li>Person lives in a “massage” business or is not free to come and go.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To report human trafficking, dial 911 in an emergency and alert the police. Providing information such as
            pictures, license plate numbers, detailed information, and observations are helpful.
        </p>
        <p>You can also report via National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888, or text “Help” or “Info” to

                        the roadway prohibits drivers from crossing it to bypass someone making a left turn. Some
                        municipalities have removed these lines to prevent bottlenecks on single-lane roads caused by
                        drivers held up by left-turning vehicles.

                            Thick Solid White Line
                        </strong>
                        A thick solid white line at a stop sign indicates that drivers must stop before the line.
                        Intermittent vertical thick white lines indicate crosswalk areas without stop signs or normal
                        traffic lights. Drivers must stop when pedestrians intend to cross at these locations. Some
                        modern
                        alternating yellow lights are placed at these "zebra" style crosswalks to alert drivers to
                        pedestrian traffic. Drivers can proceed once pedestrians have cleared the intersection; there's
                        no
                        need to wait until the lights stop flashing.

                            Parallel Horizontal White Lines
                        </strong>
                        Parallel horizontal white-lined crosswalks are found at traffic-light or stop-sign
                        intersections.
                        These crosswalks tend to be busier than "zebra" crosswalks due to the presence of larger groups
                        of
                        pedestrians in urban areas. Drivers are generally more cautious at parallel solid-lined
                        crosswalks
                        because of the predictable pedestrian activity. However, drivers should not become complacent
                        and
                        must remain alert when approaching any crosswalk.

                    <p><strong>
                            Zebra Style Lines
                        </strong>
                        "Zebra" crossings often see more close calls compared to horizontally lined crosswalks where
                        stopping at a sign or red traffic light is mandatory. Even if municipalities mistakenly paint
                        "zebra" lines where solid crosswalk lines should be placed, drivers must stop at stop signs.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>
                            Diamond or Bicycle Symbol
                        </strong>
                        Many inner-city roads feature solid white lines separating a diamond or bicycle symbol from the
                        regularly traveled portion of the road. These symbols indicate lanes reserved for specific types
                        of
                        traffic flow, typically in the same direction as regular traffic. Vehicle drivers are not
                        permitted
                        to drive in bicycle lanes except where dashed white lines are present, usually near
                        intersections.
