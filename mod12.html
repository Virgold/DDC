                                road. In Texas, where heavy traffic and long commutes are prevalent, road rage incidents
                                have become a
                                concerning issue. Factors such as stress, anonymity behind the wheel, and individual

                                contribute to the manifestation of road rage. Tailgating, honking, gestures, and verbal

                                addressing this issue. Here, we will shed light on the typical behaviors displayed by
                                individuals
                                experiencing road rage, raising awareness and promoting a safer driving culture.</span>

                                and the use of verbal abuse. Aggressive drivers often resort to continuous honking,
                                directed not only at
                                other drivers but also at pedestrians and cyclists. Verbal abuse, ranging from
                                profanity-laden insults
                                to

                                often associated with aggressive driving. This behavior displayed by some drivers aim to
                                intimidate and
                                pressure the other driver ahead into driving faster or changing lanes. Tailgating not

                                safety but can also escalate tensions on the road.</span></p>

                                signaling, cutting off other vehicles, or weaving in and out of traffic. Speeding is
                                another prevalent
                                behavior associated with road rage, as drivers attempt to assert dominance or satisfy
                                their impatience.
                                These actions significantly increase the risk of accidents and jeopardize the safety of
                                others.</span>

                                not just as a warning signal, but also to express frustration or anger. Flashing

                                showing the middle finger or making provocative hand signs. Physical confrontations can
                                also occur when
                                aggressive drivers exit their vehicles to engage in altercations with other motorists.
                                These
                                confrontations
                                can quickly escalate into dangerous situations and put individuals at risk.</span></p>

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One prominent cause of aggressive driving is traffic congestion. Long

                                gridlock, and slow-moving traffic can test even the most patient individuals.
                                Frustration mounts when
                                drivers face frequent stops, limited mobility, and significant time delays, leading to
                                heightened stress
                                levels and a higher likelihood of aggressive behaviors.</span></p>

                                road or
                                a need to assert dominance, can also contribute to aggressive driving. Furthermore,
