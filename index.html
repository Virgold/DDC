        <h2>Certification</h2>
        <p>Upon successful completion of the 6-hour defensive driving course, participants receive a Certificate of
            Completion. This certificate is required to remove the points off your license. You may choose to have it
            delivered immediately or within 7 to 10 days. Once you receive it, you are the one responsible to submit it
            to the court. The certificate comes with a watermark, so take care of your copy. If you misplace it, you can
            reach out to us so we can give another copy.
