            Importance of Traffic Laws
        </h2>
        <p>Traffic laws are not arbitrary rules but a vital framework designed to ensure the safety of road users and
            the community as a whole. Enforcing these laws brings about numerous benefits that contribute to a safer and
            more efficient driving environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the primary advantages of traffic laws is the reduction of accidents and injuries. By establishing
            guidelines and standards for driving behavior, traffic laws promote responsible and safe practices. They
            address crucial aspects such as speed limits, signaling requirements, and right-of-way, which play a pivotal
            role in preventing collisions and safeguarding lives. Adhering to traffic laws significantly decreases the
            risk of accidents and the resulting injuries or fatalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to enhancing safety, traffic laws facilitate the efficient flow of traffic. By clearly defining
            rights-of-way, signaling procedures, and rules for merging and overtaking, they promote a smooth traffic
            flow and prevent congestion. When drivers understand and follow these laws, traffic moves more smoothly,
            reducing delays and frustration for all road users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, traffic laws prioritize the protection of vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and
            cyclists. By establishing regulations that grant them rights and ensure their safety, traffic laws
            contribute to a more inclusive and equitable road environment. This helps create a culture of respect and
            consideration, fostering a safer space for all users to navigate.

        <h2>Speeding Consequences and Risks</h2>
        <p>Speeding or exceeding the established speed limit in a certain area can have serious consequences and risks.
            Below are some of the key factors to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reduced Reaction Time: </strong>
            Driving at high speeds reduces the available time to react to hazards or unexpected situations on the road.
            A shorter reaction time increases the likelihood of collisions and decreases the chances of avoiding them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Increased Stopping Distance:</strong>Higher speeds require longer distances to bring a vehicle to a
            complete stop. This extended stopping distance can lead to rear-end collisions, or the inability to stop in
            time to avoid hitting an obstacle.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reduced Vehicle Control:</strong>Speeding compromises the stability and control of a vehicle. It
            becomes more difficult to steer, maneuver, and navigate curves safely. The risk of losing control and
            causing an accident significantly increases at higher speeds.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The magnitude of Impact: </strong>
            The force of impact in a collision increases exponentially with speed. Higher speeds result in more severe
            crashes and a greater risk of life-threatening injuries or fatalities.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Pedestrian Safety:</strong>Speeding in areas with pedestrians, such as residential zones or school
            areas, puts vulnerable road users at greater risk. Higher speeds reduce the time available to react and
            avoid collisions, posing a danger to pedestrians.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is crucial to recognize and understand the potential consequences of speeding. By adhering to speed
            limits and driving at appropriate speeds, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with excessive
            speed and prioritize the safety of yourself and others on the road.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Safe and Responsible Driving</h2>
        <p>To ensure safe driving and respect for speed limits you should take note of the different positive behaviors.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Observe posted speed limits: </strong> Be aware of and adhere to the posted speed limits on different
            roads and in various situations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Adjust speed to conditions: </strong>Adjust your speed based on road conditions, weather, traffic
            flow, and the presence of pedestrians or cyclists.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Plan Ahead: </strong>Plan your travel and allow sufficient time for your journey to avoid the
            temptation of speeding up due to time pressure. </p>

        <p><strong>Use cruise control: </strong>Utilize cruise control on highways to maintain a consistent and legal
            speed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Be aware of surroundings: </strong>Stay alert to potential speed limit changes, school zones,
            construction zones, or other areas with specific speed restrictions</p>
        <p><strong>Lead by Example:</strong>Set a good example for other drivers by respecting speed limits and
            practicing safe driving habits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adhering to speed limits is not only a legal requirement but also your responsibility as a driver to ensure
            the safety of yourself, your passengers, and other road users. By driving at appropriate speeds, you
            contribute to a safer and more harmonious road environment. Remember, it's better to arrive a little later
            than to risk lives by speeding.

                Red Light:
            </strong>
            Requires all vehicles to stop completely behind the designated stop line or crosswalk.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Green Light:
            </strong>
            Indicates permission to proceed, but drivers should still yield to pedestrians and
            vehicles that are already in the intersection.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Yellow Light:
            </strong>
            Warns that the signal is about to change from green to red. Drivers should prepare to stop
            safely unless it is unsafe to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>
                Pedestrian Signals:
            </strong>
            Provides specific instructions for pedestrians, indicating when it is safe to cross the
            road.</p>
        <p><strong>
                Turn Signals:
            </strong>
            Indicates when it is safe to make specific turns, through arrows or separate signals.</p>
        <p><strong>
                Flashing Signals:
            </strong>
            Flashing red signals require drivers to come to a complete stop and proceed only
            when it is safe. Flashing yellow signals indicate caution and require drivers to move with care.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Adhering to Traffic Sign and signals</h2>
        <p>Adhering to traffic signs and signals is crucial for several reasons. </p>
        <p><strong>
                Safety:
            </strong>
            Following traffic signs and signals enhances road safety by reducing the risk of accidents, collisions, and
            conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Orderly Traffic Flow
            </strong>
            Traffic signs and signals facilitate smooth traffic flow, preventing congestion and
            minimizing delays.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Uniformity and Predictability:
            </strong> Consistent adherence to traffic signs and signals by all road users creates a
            predictable and orderly road environment. When everyone follows the same rules, it reduces confusion and
            improves overall traffic efficiency.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety:
            </strong>Traffic signs and signals play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of
            pedestrians and cyclists by providing designated crossings, signaling the right of way, and alerting drivers
            to
            their presence.</p>

        <p><strong>
                Legal Compliance:
            </strong>
            Adhering to traffic signs and signals is a legal requirement. Failure to comply can result in
            traffic violations, fines, demerit points on your driving record, increased insurance premiums, and
            potentially
            license suspension or revocation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Communication and Understanding:
            </strong>
            Traffic signs and signals serve as a universal language on the road, allowing
            drivers from different regions and backgrounds to understand and respond appropriately to the given
            instructions.

        <h2>

            Understanding Traffic Signs and Signals
        </h2>
        <p>
            To effectively navigate the road and comply with traffic signs and signals you should take note of the
            guidelines below.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Familiarize Yourself:
            </strong>
            Take the time to learn and understand the meaning of different traffic signs,
            including
            regulatory, warning, guide, and informational signs. Study the colors, shapes, symbols, and text used on
            these
            signs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Pay Attention:
            </strong>
            Stay alert and watch for traffic signs and signals as you drive. Be observant of changes in
            signage, especially in unfamiliar areas.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Follow Instructions:
            </strong>
            Obey the instructions given by traffic signs and signals promptly and accurately.
            Adhering
            to their guidance ensures your safety and the safety of others on the road.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Yield and Right of Way:
            </strong>
            Understand the right of way at intersections and yield to pedestrians and vehicles
            as
            indicated by signs and signals. Respect the flow of traffic and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Stay Informed:
            </strong>
            Keep up to date with any changes or updates to traffic signs and signals in your area. Be
            aware
            of temporary signs and signals in construction zones or during special events.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Practice Defensive Driving:
            </strong>
            Even if you have the right of way, remain cautious and anticipate the actions of
            other drivers. Not all road users may follow traffic signs and signals correctly, so practicing defensive
            driving is essential to avoid potential hazards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, traffic signs and signals are in place to ensure the safety and efficiency of our roadways.
            Adhering
            to these signs and signals is a responsibility shared by all road users. By respecting and following them,
            you
            contribute to a safer and more harmonious transportation system.

        <h2>Right-of-Way</h2>
        <p class="fw-bold">Right-of-way is a fundamental concept in traffic rules that determines who has the legal
            privilege to proceed
            first in a given traffic situation. It establishes a hierarchical order to ensure safe and efficient traffic
            flow. Understanding and respecting right-of-way rules is crucial for all road users to prevent accidents and
            promote smooth interactions on the road. The next topic will let you dig deeper into this driving concept.

        <h2>Importance of Understanding Right-of-Way</h2>

        <p><strong>
                Safety:
            </strong>
            Right-of-way rules are designed to prevent collisions and promote the safety of all road users. By
            understanding and following these rules, drivers, and pedestrians can anticipate the actions of others and
            make informed decisions, reducing the risk of accidents.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Smooth Traffic Flow:
            </strong>
            Adhering to right-of-way rules helps maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic.
            When
            each road user knows when to yield and when to proceed, it minimizes conflicts and congestion at
            intersections
            and other areas where the right-of-way comes into play.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Courtesy and Respect:
            </strong>
            Respecting the right-of-way demonstrates courteous and respectful behavior towards
            other
            road users. It promotes a positive driving culture and helps create a safer and more pleasant environment
            for
            everyone.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Legal Compliance:
            </strong>
            Failure to yield the right-of-way when required can result in traffic violations, fines,
            points on your driving record, increased insurance premiums, and potentially license suspension or
            revocation.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Common Misunderstandings
        </h2>
        <p>
            Misunderstandings or misinterpretations of right-of-way rules can lead to confusion and dangerous
            situations.
            Below are some of the common right-of-way misconceptions.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Assuming Right-of-Way:
            </strong>
            Never assume other drivers will yield the right-of-way. Always be prepared to yield and
            proceed with caution.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Yielding at Stop Signs:
            </strong>
            Coming to a complete stop at a stop sign is necessary, even if you believe you have
            the
            right-of-way. Always yield to other vehicles as required.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Pedestrian Right-of-Way:
            </strong>
            Pedestrians have the right-of-way at crosswalks, but they should still exercise
            caution
            and ensure it is safe to cross before stepping into the roadway.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Turning Right on Red:
            </strong>
            In areas where right turns on red are permitted, drivers must yield to pedestrians and
            oncoming traffic before making the turn.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Emergency Vehicles:
            </strong>
            When emergency vehicles approach with lights and sirens, it is crucial to yield and
            provide
            them with a clear path to pass. You may pull over to the side of the road safely and allow them to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>

            By respecting right-of-way rules, we contribute to safer roadways and create a more cooperative and
            efficient
            traffic environment. Remember, it is better to yield and wait for the appropriate time to proceed than to
            risk a
            collision or endanger others by asserting the right-of-way inappropriately. Stay vigilant, be courteous, and
            prioritize safety for yourself and others on the road.

        <h2>
            Lane Usage
        </h2>
        <p><strong>
                Traffic laws specify how lanes should be used to maintain order and safety on the roads. Drivers must
                follow
                these rules for changing lanes, merging, and keeping a safe distance from other vehicles. Lane usage
                refers
                to the proper and lawful positioning of vehicles within designated lanes on the roadway. Understanding
                and
                following lane usage guidelines is essential for maintaining order, promoting safety, and ensuring
                smooth
                traffic flow.
            </strong>
            <br>

            Let's delve into the topic of lane usage.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Lane Positioning
        </h2>
        <p>
            Proper lane positioning is essential for safe and effective driving. It involves being mindful of your lane
            boundaries and using the appropriate lane for your intended actions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the key considerations for effective lane positioning are discussed below.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Stay in Your Lane:
            </strong>
            Maintain your position within the boundaries of your designated lane. Avoid drifting into
            adjacent lanes or straddling lane markings.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Center Lane Usage:
            </strong>

            On roads with multiple lanes in each direction, the center lane is typically used for
            through
            traffic, while the outer lanes are used for merging, turning, or exiting. Stay in the appropriate lane based
            on
            your intended direction of travel.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Lane Courtesy:
            </strong>
            Practice lane courtesy by using the right lane for slower speeds and allowing faster-moving
            vehicles to pass on the left. Be aware of your surroundings and adjust your speed and lane position
            accordingly.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Lane Changes:
            </strong>
            When changing lanes, use your turn signals to indicate your intention to other drivers. Check your
            mirrors and blind spots to ensure it is safe to proceed. Yield to other vehicles and merge smoothly into the
            desired lane. Avoid making sudden or abrupt lane changes that can surprise or endanger other drivers.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Lane Discipline
        </h2>
        <p>

            Adhering to lane discipline contributes to safe and efficient traffic flow.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Keep to the Right:
            </strong>

            Unless passing or preparing for a left turn, drivers should generally keep to the
            right-hand
            lane. This allows faster-moving vehicles to pass on the left.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Passing on Multi-Lane Roads:
            </strong>
            When passing slower vehicles on multi-lane roads, use the left lane. After
            completing the pass, return to the right lane.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Slower Traffic:
            </strong>
            Slower-moving vehicles, such as trucks or vehicles towing trailers, should use the
            right-hand
            lanes to allow faster-moving traffic to pass safely.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Carpool Lanes and HOV Lanes:
            </strong>
            Carpool lanes or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are designated for vehicles
            carrying multiple occupants. Familiarize yourself with the specific rules and requirements for using these
            lanes.

        <h2>
            Lane Usage for Turns
        </h2>
        <p>
            Proper lane usage is essential when making turns to ensure safety and efficiency. Below are some guidelines
            for
            different types of turns.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Right Turns:
            </strong>
            When making a right turn, approach the intersection from the right-hand lane, staying as close to
            the curb as possible. Yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic, and signal your intention to turn. Maintain
            a
            smooth arc as you make the turn, keeping a safe distance from the curb or any obstacles.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Left Turns:
            </strong>
            When making a left turn, position your vehicle in the lane closest to the centerline or median.
            This
            allows for a clear view of oncoming traffic and provides sufficient space to complete the turn safely. Yield
            to
            oncoming traffic and pedestrians, and use your turn signal to indicate your intention to turn. Wait for a
            safe
            gap in traffic before initiating the turn, and keep a close eye on approaching vehicles.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Multiple Turn Lanes:
            </strong>
            In some situations, intersections may have multiple turn lanes. Choose the appropriate
            lane
            based on your intended direction of travel and follow the lane markings and signs. If you are unsure, follow
            the
            arrows or signs indicating the specific lane for your desired turn. It is important to stay in your
            designated
            lane and avoid drifting into adjacent lanes during the turn.

        <h2>
            Special Lane Usage Situations
        </h2>
        <p><strong>
                In addition to standard lane usage, there are specific situations that require special attention and
                adherence
                to lane guidelines.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Bike Lanes:
            </strong>
            Respect designated bike lanes by refraining from driving or parking in them. Be aware of
            cyclists
            using the bike lanes and yield to them when necessary. Maintain a safe distance when passing cyclists and
            avoid
            any sudden lane changes that may jeopardize their safety.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Bus Lanes:
            </strong>
            Some roads have dedicated lanes exclusively for buses. Unless you are driving a bus or have
            explicit
            permission, refrain from using these lanes. Be aware of bus lanes and respect their purpose to ensure smooth
            and
            efficient transit for public transportation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Construction Zones:
            </strong>
            Construction zones often have specific lane usage instructions due to road work or
            maintenance activities. Pay close attention to signage, signals, and instructions provided by road workers.
            Lanes may be shifted, narrowed, or temporarily closed, so follow the designated lanes and adjust your
            driving
            accordingly.
            <br>

            It is crucial to be aware of these special lane usage situations and follow the specific guidelines
            associated
            with them. Understanding and adhering to these guidelines contribute to maintaining orderly traffic flow,
            reducing the risk of accidents, and promoting a safer and more efficient driving environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            By practicing proper lane usage in all situations, you play an important role in creating a smoother and
            more
            harmonious roadway experience for everyone.

        <h2>
            Driving on Improved Shoulder
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are few instances where driving on an improved shoulder of the roadway is allowed. Under these
            circumstances, a driver may use the rightmost lane legally.
            To stop, stand, or park;
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                To accelerate before entering the main traveled lane of traffic;
            </li>
            <li>
                To decelerate before making a right turn;
            </li>
            <li>
                To pass another vehicle that is slowing, stopped, disabled, or preparing to make a left turn on the main
                part of
                the roadway;
            </li>
            <li>
                To allow another vehicle traveling faster to pass;
            </li>
            <li>
                To follow directions given by an official traffic-control device; or
            </li>
            <li>
                To avoid a collision.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Drivers are required to use caution when using the improved shoulder and only in these situations. On the
            other
            hand, emergency vehicles and police patrols are not limited from using the shoulder lane. When you notice an
            emergency or police vehicle behind you on the rightmost lane, make sure to give space, slow down, and use
            caution.

        <h2>Litter Prevention
        </h2>
        <p>
            While litter may seem commonplace and negligible, in Texas it is a serious issue. In 2013, Texas Department
            of Transportation estimated that 1.5 billion pieces of litter left behind on Texas roads needed addressing.
            The year prior in 2012, the department spent $47 million just to clean up the roads.
        </p>
        <p>Amazingly, 31% of these are cigarette butts that may even increase the risk of wildfires. Drivers caught
            littering in Texas roads may suffer the following consequences, depending on the weight of the trash:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Litter weighing up to 5 pounds – Class C misdemeanor with $ 500 fine
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighing between 5 to 500 pounds – Class B misdemeanor with fine of up to $2,000 and / or as many as 180
                days in jail
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighing between 500 to 1,000 pounds – Class A misdemeanor with fine of up to $4,000
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            On top of these, community service may also be required for those caught in the act of littering.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>
            Compulsary Insurance
        </h2>

        <p>Texas requires that all drivers insure their vehicles under the 30 / 60 / 25 rule of thumb coverage. This
            rule applies to the minimum insurance coverage that each driver must have in line with Texas laws.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>$30,000 per injured person and minimum of $60,000 per accident
            </li>
            <li>$25,000 insurance for property damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While proof of insurance is adequate for drivers without violations, Texas requires SR-22 or Certificate of
            Financial Responsibility if it is court-ordered or required by the Department of Public Safety.
            <br>
            Drivers who were involved in a car crash are required to file their SR-22 certificate with the Department of
            Public Safety. Likewise, those who are cited twice for driving without insurance will be asked by Texas to
            file an SR-22.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Interaction with Law Enforcement
        </h2>
        <p>When asked by an officer to stop, promptly respond to give the officer time to carry out his task. Remain
            calm, follow instructions, and communicate honestly. Be ready to present your documents and identification.
            For a smooth interaction, these are do’s and don’ts when in a traffic stop with a police officer:
        </p>
        <p>While being stopped by an officer, you should do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promptly reduce speed and pull over to the right side of the road as soon as it is safe to do so.
            </li>
            <li>Park your vehicle on the right shoulder safely. If this is not possible, choose the safest area nearby
                with low traffic.
            </li>
            <li>In conditions where there is low light or poor visibility, switch your hazard lights on.
            </li>
            <li>
                For safety, an officer may opt to approach from the right side of your vehicle
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do the following while your vehicle remains parked: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use your emergency brake and park mode, then switch off the engine.
            </li>
            <li>The officer should be able to see your hands on the steering wheel, while the hands of passengers should
                be visible as well.
            </li>
            <li>Lower your window—failure to do so is illegal. </li>
            <li>Communicate openly with the officer. Before attempting to reach for documents or your license, notify
                the officer of where you will get them. If there is a firearm inside your vehicle, let the officer know.
                Your required documents should be located separately from the firearm.
            </li>
            <li>Listen carefully and follow the officer’s instructions. When the officer approaches your vehicle,
                movements such as reaching for or searching for required documents, may be seen as performing something
                illegal.
            </li>
            <li>Remain inside the vehicle unless you are instructed to exit the car. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are what you should not do in your interaction with an officer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reach or search for documents of license even before or while the officer approaches your car
            </li>
            <li>Attempt to leave a traffic stop while the officer is still carrying out his procedure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you suspect that the vehicle calling your attention is not a police officer, drive slowly towards a
            populated area and call 9-1-1. You may wait for the officer to be identified before ending the call.

            Child Passenger Restraint System
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Texas, the law requires the use of seat belts. For children, the appropriate seat belts must be used so
            they can remain safe in the vehicle. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines, and of course, an added
            risk in case of collision.
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to their size kids have to wear customizes seat belts fit for their height. Various options in the
            market make it easier for them to get accustomed to wearing seat belts as well until they are tall enough to
            wear the built-in seat belts. If you are transporting your kids in your vehicle, check out the various
            age-appropriate child restraint systems that they can wear.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Rear-facing seats (birth to 12 months)
            </strong>
            From birth to 12 months, rear-facing seats are appropriate to transport your kids in your car. Choose the
            ones with higher weight and height limits so you can use it for much longer for your child. Rear-facing
            seats are the only option for infants when carrying them in your car.
            <br>
            For as long as your kid remains comfortable and tethered appropriately, you can use a rear-facing seat until
            the age of 3. When necessary, upgrade to a forward-facing seat so your kid can remain comfortable when
            seated in the car.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Forward-facing seats (1 – 3 and 4 – 7 years old)
            </strong>
            Similar to rear-facing seats, choose the one with the highest weight and height limits. You may use
            forward-facing seats for your kid until the age of 7, provided that he or she is still within the prescribed
            limits.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Booster seat (4 – 7 and 8 – 12 years old)
            </strong>
            Booster seats are the last child restraint system your kid can occupy until he or she finally reaches the
            height of a young teen. Until your kid is taller than 4 feet and 9 inches, remaining on the booster seat is
            the safe option.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are several products in the market, make sure the one you are buying is approved by federal
            standards. Traveling with the peace of mind that your kids are safely restrained frees you up to focus on
            driving.

        <h2>Leaving Children in the Car</h2>
        <p>A vehicle left under the intense sun is going to heat like an oven. If you have a child with you in the car,
            do not leave your child alone while your vehicle is parked. When the temperature heats up, the child can
            suffer hyperthermia or heat stroke that can permanently damage internal organs such as brain, liver, and
            kidney. In extreme cases, heat stroke may lead to death. </p>
        <p>
            In Texas, leaving a child younger than 7 years old alone in the car, without a guardian of at least 14 years
            of age, is a crime.
            <br>
            <br>

            It is an offense classified as a Class C misdemeanor and a crime punishable under the Texas Penal Code.

            Human Trafficking Prevention (SB 1831)
        </h2>
        <p>
            According to a report in 2016, 300,000 Texans are victims of trafficking and around 79,000 of them are
            children. The government of Texas is serious in clamping down on this menace, encouraging civil society to
            work together with the state in bringing down these lawless elements and taking them to justice.
        </p>
        <p>As a citizen of the state, you can contribute by knowing the red flags of human trafficking. The Attorney
            General of the state lists down some of the indicators of a victim of sex trafficking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person seems overly fearful, submissive, tense, or paranoid.
            </li>
            <li>Person defers to another person before giving information.
            </li>
            <li>Person has physical injuries or branding such as name tattoos on face or chest, tattoos about money and
                sex, or pimp phrases.
            </li>
            <li>Wears clothing that is inappropriately sexual or inappropriate for weather.
            </li>
            <li>Minor is unaccompanied at night or cannot explain who they are with and what they are doing.
            </li>
            <li>They do not possess identification documents because they are held by another person.
            </li>
            <li>Person works long or excessive hours or is always available “on demand.”
            </li>
            <li>Overly sexual for age or situation.
            </li>
            <li>The person has multiple phones or social media accounts.
            </li>
            <li>Signs of unusual and unexplained wealth—new jewelry, shoes, phones without any known form of income.
            </li>
            <li>Person lives in a “massage” business or is not free to come and go.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To report human trafficking, dial 911 in an emergency and alert the police. Providing information such as
            pictures, license plate numbers, detailed information, and observations are helpful.
        </p>
        <p>You can also report via National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888, or text “Help” or “Info” to

                        caution." However, be cautious of drivers attempting to pass when the line is solid, as not all

                        Double solid yellow lines indicate no passing in any direction. If a broken yellow line runs
                        parallel to a solid one, traffic on the broken-line side can pass when safe, while traffic on

                            Broken Yellow Lines
                        </strong>
                        A broken yellow center line on a two-way road indicates that passing is permitted when safe to
                        do so.
                    </p>

                            Double Broken Yellow Lines
                        </strong>
                        Double broken yellow lines denote reversible lanes. Overhead lane-control lights
                        (red/yellow/green)
                        will guide drivers on which lanes they can use.
                    </p>

                            Diagonal Yellow Stripes
                        </strong>
                        Yellow-painted islands with diagonal yellow stripes instruct drivers to stay to the right of
                        these
                        stripes and not drive on or over them. They serve as imaginary boulevards.

                            Broken Yellow Lines with Outside Solid Lines
                        </strong>
                        Inside broken yellow lines accompanied by outside solid yellow lines designate a two-way
                        oncoming
                        left-turn lane. Opposing drivers share this lane for left turns. This lane should only be used
                        for
                        turning, not for advancing forward.

                            Broken White Line
                        </strong>
                        White center lines separate traffic moving in the same direction and are most noticeable on
                        one-way
                        streets.

                            Solid White Line
                        </strong>
                        A solid white line indicates that lane changes are not allowed. A solid white line at the side
                        of
                        the roadway prohibits drivers from crossing it to bypass someone making a left turn. Some
                        municipalities have removed these lines to prevent bottlenecks on single-lane roads caused by
                        drivers held up by left-turning vehicles.
                    </p>

                            Thick Solid White Line
                        </strong>
                        A thick solid white line at a stop sign indicates that drivers must stop before the line.
                        Intermittent vertical thick white lines indicate crosswalk areas without stop signs or normal
                        traffic lights. Drivers must stop when pedestrians intend to cross at these locations. Some
                        modern
                        alternating yellow lights are placed at these "zebra" style crosswalks to alert drivers to
                        pedestrian traffic. Drivers can proceed once pedestrians have cleared the intersection; there's
                        no
                        need to wait until the lights stop flashing.

                            Parallel Horizontal White Lines
                        </strong>
                        Parallel horizontal white-lined crosswalks are found at traffic-light or stop-sign
                        intersections.
                        These crosswalks tend to be busier than "zebra" crosswalks due to the presence of larger groups
                        of
                        pedestrians in urban areas. Drivers are generally more cautious at parallel solid-lined
                        crosswalks
                        because of the predictable pedestrian activity. However, drivers should not become complacent
                        and
                        must remain alert when approaching any crosswalk.

                    <p><strong>
                            Zebra Style Lines
                        </strong>
                        "Zebra" crossings often see more close calls compared to horizontally lined crosswalks where
                        stopping at a sign or red traffic light is mandatory. Even if municipalities mistakenly paint
                        "zebra" lines where solid crosswalk lines should be placed, drivers must stop at stop signs.

                            Diamond or Bicycle Symbol
                        </strong>
                        Many inner-city roads feature solid white lines separating a diamond or bicycle symbol from the
                        regularly traveled portion of the road. These symbols indicate lanes reserved for specific types
                        of
                        traffic flow, typically in the same direction as regular traffic. Vehicle drivers are not
                        permitted
                        to drive in bicycle lanes except where dashed white lines are present, usually near
                        intersections.
