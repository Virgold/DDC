                weather
                conditions.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Carry necessary tools:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Keep

                the
                one ahead to allow for safe braking.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Use headlights and fog lights:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Turn on your
                headlights when visibility is reduced, and utilize fog lights if your vehicle is equipped with them.
                This
                helps other drivers see you and improves your own visibility.</span></p>

                distractions while
                driving,

                            traction and
                            visibility. However, with the right knowledge and precautions, you can navigate through
                            rainy conditions
                            safely. Here are some guidelines to follow.:</span></p>

                            class="c0">&nbsp;Ensure your tires
                            have adequate
                            tread depth and ensure they are properly inflated. Good traction is essential for
                            maintaining control on wet
                            surfaces.</span></p>
                    <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Test your brakes:</strong></span><span
                            class="c0">&nbsp;Make sure your
                            brakes are in
                            optimal condition. Wet roads require longer braking distances, so having well-functioning
                            brakes is
                            crucial.</span></p>

                            drive at a moderate
                            speed to account for reduced traction. This allows for better control and more time to react
                            to potential
                            hazards.</span></p>

                            distance between your vehicle and the one ahead. This extra space allows for increased
                            braking time and
                            reduces the risk of collisions.</span></p>

                            even during daylight hours, to improve visibility for yourself and other drivers. Avoid
                            using high beams, as
                            they can reflect off the rain and impair visibility.</span></p>

                            condition for
                            optimal clearing of the windshield.</span></p>

                            conditioning to prevent fogging on the inside of your windows. Keep a microfiber cloth or a
                            handy window
                            cleaner to clear any condensation that may accumulate.</span></p>

            By adjusting your driving speed, maintaining a safe following distance, and using headlights and windshield
            wipers effectively, you can navigate rainy conditions with confidence. When driving on snow and ice,
            remember to drive smoothly, brake gently, and ensure your tires are appropriate for the conditions. In foggy
            conditions, reduce your speed, use fog lights and low-beam headlights, and stay alert for potential hazards.

            Strong winds can be challenging, but by keeping a firm grip on the steering wheel and being cautious of
            crosswinds and debris, you can maintain control. During thunderstorms and lightning, find a safe place to
            pull over, avoid open areas and tall objects, and prepare for possibility of flash flooding.
