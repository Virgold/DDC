        <h2>Speeding</h2>
        <p>Speeding is one of the most prevalent traffic violations. It refers to driving above the posted speed limit
            or at a speed that is unsafe for the prevailing conditions. Consequences of speeding include fines, points
            on the driving record, and the possibility of license suspension. It is important to recognize the risks
            associated with speeding and the importance of adhering to speed limits for the safety of all road users.
            <br>
            In Texas, speeding is a common traffic violation with specific consequences.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Fines:
            </strong>
            The fine for speeding varies depending on how much over the speed limit you were driving. The exact
            amount can be found in the Texas Transportation Code. Generally, the fine increases with the severity of the
            speeding offense.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Points:
            </strong>
            Speeding convictions can result in the accumulation of points on your driving record in Texas. The
            number of points assigned (2-3) depends on the speed over the limit.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                License Suspension:
            </strong>
            If you accumulate too many points within a specific period, your driver’s license may be
            suspended. <strong>
                In Texas, if you accumulate 6 or more points within 36 months, you may face license suspension.</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Increased Insurance Premiums:
            </strong>
            Speeding violations can lead to an increase in your auto insurance premiums
            due to
            the perception of higher risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to remember that these consequences may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the
            speeding offense and the discretion of law enforcement and the court. It's always advisable to consult local
            traffic laws, regulations, and insurance providers to understand the exact fines, points, and potential
            license
            suspension or increased insurance premiums associated with speeding violations in Texas.

        <h2>Street Racing
        </h2>
        <p>
            Street racing in Texas is a Class B misdemeanor. If a driver gets caught the second or third time, the fines
            and penalties go up. In case the driver’s participation in the street race results in property damage or
            bodily injury, the vehicle will be impounded.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the driver caused bodily injury, the crime is now considered a 3rd degree felony and up to 10 years in
            prison. Worse, jail time can reach up to 20 years if the bodily injuries are serious or if it resulted in
            death. In those cases, the crime is a 2nd degree felony. A lifetime imprisonment is possible for drivers
            convicted multiple times of street racing classified as 2nd degree felony.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Texas law, a driver may not participate in any of the following:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>a race;</li>
            <li>a vehicle speed competition or contest;</li>

                speed record.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>
                Fines:
            </strong>
            The first offence has a $2,000 fine, and the third offense reaches $10,000 in fines.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Points:
            </strong>
            3 points are indicated on the record if the violation resulted in injury or property damage. However,
            the points may add up as authorities may also charge the defendant with reckless driving and speeding.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                License Suspension:
            </strong>
            License may be suspended up to 1 year.

            (IID)
            in your vehicle. This device measures your BAC before allowing the vehicle to start. If alcohol is detected
            above a certain threshold, the vehicle will not start. IID installation and maintenance expenses are
            typically
            the responsibility of the offender.

        <p><strong>
                Increased Insurance Premiums:
            </strong>
            DUI convictions are likely to result in significantly higher insurance
            premiums or
            even the cancellation of your policy. Insurance companies perceive DUI offenses as high-risk behavior,
            making
            you a more costly policyholder to insure.
            <br>
            It's essential to prioritize the safety of yourself and others on the road by never driving under the
            influence
            of alcohol or drugs. Designated drivers, rideshare services, or alternative transportation options should be
            available for you when impaired. Remember, the consequences of DUI offenses extend beyond legal penalties
            and
            can have long-lasting effects on your personal and professional life.

            Failure to Wear Seat Belts
        </h2>
        <p>
            Failing to wear a seatbelt is a common violation that compromises personal safety in the event of a
            collision.
            Seatbelts are designed to save lives and minimize the impact of collisions by preventing occupants from
            being
            ejected or thrown around inside the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Failing to wear seat belts or not ensuring that passengers are properly restrained is a violation with
            consequences in Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Texas, law enforcement requires even backseat passengers to wear seatbelts when it is available.
            Children,
            when they are below 8 years old must occupy a car seat or car booster seat. Kids who are above 4 feet and 9
            inches may use the car’s built-in seat belt instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2022, Texas 284 pickup truck drivers who died in collisions did not wear their seatbelts. While failure
            to
            wear seat belts may be expensive if caught by an officer, this legal measure emphasizes how seat belts
            actually
            save lives. There is no other way to protect passengers from getting launched and ejected out of the car in
            a
            collision than to wear a seat belt.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
                Fines:
            </strong>
            Violations for not wearing seat belts can result in fines, which vary depending on the jurisdiction.
            In
            Texas, the fine for a first offense can range from <strong> $25 to $200.</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Safety Risks:
            </strong>
            Failing to wear seat belts increases the risk of severe injuries or fatalities in the event of
            an
            accident. Wearing seat belts is a simple yet crucial step in protecting yourself and your passengers on the
            road.

            Improper Lane Changes

            Improper lane changes can disrupt the flow of traffic and increase the risk of accidents, especially when
            done
            without signaling or checking blind spots. Making unsafe or improper lane changes can lead to hazardous
            situations on the road.

        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Increased Insurance Premiums:
            </strong>
            Insurance companies may perceive improper lane changes as a higher risk
            behavior,
            resulting in increased premiums.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
                Potential Collisions:
            </strong>
            Making unsafe lane changes can lead to side-swipe accidents or collisions with other
            vehicles, endangering the safety of everyone on the road. Always use your signals, check your mirrors, and
            ensure it is safe before changing lanes.

                Fines:
            </strong>
            The fine for failure to yield in Texas can range from <strong>$175 to $200</strong> for a first offense. The
