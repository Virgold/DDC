                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In bad weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow, visibility

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wet, icy, or snowy roads reduce tire traction, leading to longer stopping
                                distances.

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s crucial to increase your following distance, allowing your

                                time
                                to come to a complete stop. This extra space gives you a buffer to react to sudden
                                changes in traffic or

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When driving on wet roads, there is a risk of hydroplaning, where your
                                tires lose
                                contact with the road surface and glide on a thin layer of water. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To prevent hydroplaning, maintain the appropriate tire tread depth,
                                reduce your
                                speed, avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and drive in the tracks of the vehicle
                                ahead.</span></p>

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Icy or slippery surfaces can lead to skidding, making it challenging to
                                maintain
                                control of your vehicle. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you experience a skid, avoid panicking and gently steer in the
                                direction you
                                want
                                to go without abrupt acceleration or braking. Maintaining a calm and steady approach can
                                help you regain
                                control.</span></p>

                                cause your vehicle to sway. Adjust your speed, be cautious when passing large vehicles,
                                and maintain
                                proper

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Black ice refers to a thin, transparent layer of ice on the road that is

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Drive with extra caution, especially in shaded areas, on bridges, or
