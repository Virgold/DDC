                            Being aware of your surroundings is crucial for defensive driving. Scanning the road and
                            checking blind spots helps you detect potential hazards, avoid collisions, and make safe
                            maneuvers.

                            <li><strong> Use your peripheral vision: </strong> Expand your field of view by using your
                                peripheral vision to monitor
                                the sides of the road and detect objects or vehicles approaching from the sides.
                                Look ahead: Focus on the middle distance of the road to anticipate potential hazards or
                                changes

                                Correctly position your side mirrors to reduce blind spots. Angle them
                                outwards so that you can see a small portion of your vehicle in the mirror, while still
                                capturing a wider view of the adjacent lanes.</li>

                            <strong> Anticipation </strong>goes hand in hand with situational awareness. It involves
                            looking ahead and
                            predicting what may happen on the road, allowing you to take proactive measures to avoid
                            potential risks. Here are some key points regarding anticipation:

                            One of the fundamental aspects of defensive driving is maintaining a safe following distance
                            between your vehicle and the one ahead. By keeping an appropriate distance, you allow
                            yourself
                            enough time and space to react to sudden changes in traffic conditions, reducing the risk of
                            collisions. Let's explore the importance of maintaining a safe following distance and how to
                            do
                            it effectively.

                        <p><strong> Following </strong>
                            distance refers to the space between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you.
                            It
                            provides a cushion of safety that allows you to respond to any sudden stops, turns, or
                            hazards.

                                A widely used guideline for a safe following distance is the
                                "three-second
                                rule." Choose a stationary object on the side of the road, such as a sign or a lamppost,
                                and
                                start counting when the vehicle ahead passes it. If your vehicle passes the same object
                                before
                                you count to three, you are following too closely and should increase your distance.

                            Reasons to Maintain a Safe Following Distance
                        </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Reaction time: </strong>
                                A safe following distance gives you more time to react to unexpected situations.
                                It allows you to brake or maneuver safely without colliding with the vehicle in front.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong> Avoiding rear-end collisions: </strong>
                                Maintaining an appropriate distance helps prevent rear-end
                                collisions, which are common when drivers fail to leave enough room to stop in time.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong> Weather and road conditions:</strong> Adverse weather or poor road conditions
                                can affect stopping
                                distances. A safe following distance compensates for these factors, ensuring you have
                                adequate
                                space to stop safely.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The faster you're driving, the longer it takes to stop. Increase

                                distance
                                as your speed increases.</li>
                            <li><strong>
                                    Vehicle size:
                                </strong> Larger vehicles, such as trucks or buses, require more stopping distance due
                                to
                                their weight. Leave extra space when following them.</li>
                            <li> <strong>Road conditions: </strong>Tailor your following distance based on the road
                                conditions, traffic density,
                                and any potential hazards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Driver distractions:</strong> Avoid tailgating or driving too closely,
                                especially if the driver ahead is
                                distracted or exhibiting erratic behavior.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>When being tailgated:</strong>If another vehicle is following you too closely,
                                resist the urge to brake
                                suddenly or engage in aggressive behavior. If you respond aggressively, you might find
                                yourself
                                in a collision trap with little room to respond to hazards. Instead, maintain your speed
                                and
                                create more space by gradually slowing down and allowing the vehicle to pass.
                                <br>
                                Making the proper adjustment is especially important when a tailgater tries to close in
                                on the
                                space behind you. As you gradually slow down, the tailgater will instead decide to pass
                                and move
                                ahead of you. Remember, by adjusting your speed to slow down, you are keeping a safe
                                space
                                cushion ahead of you in case of any hazard.

                            <li><strong> In heavy traffic:</strong> Leave a larger gap to account for frequent stops and
