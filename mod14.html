                                checks are essential. By following a proactive approach and conducting routine

                                Let&#39;s explore some key areas that require regular maintenance.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Engine Oil</strong></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Regularly checking and changing your vehicle&#39;s engine oil is a
                                fundamental
                                maintenance task. To begin, park your vehicle on a level surface and allow the engine to
                                cool down.
                                Locate
                                the oil dipstick, usually marked with a bright-colored handle. Remove the dipstick, wipe
                                it clean,
                                reinsert
                                it, and then pull it out again. Check the oil level, ensuring it falls within the
                                recommended range
                                indicated on the dipstick. If the oil is low or appears dirty, this means it is time for
                                an oil change.
                                Consult your vehicle&#39;s owner manual or a trusted mechanic for the appropriate oil
                                type and change
                                intervals.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Fluid Levels</strong></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maintaining proper fluid levels is essential for various systems in your
                                vehicle.
                                Start by locating the fluid reservoirs, such as coolant, brake fluid, power steering
                                fluid, and
                                transmission
                                fluid. Check the fluid levels by inspecting the fluid reservoirs&#39; markings. If the
                                levels are low,
                                add
                                the recommended fluid until it reaches the appropriate level. Ensure you use the correct
                                type of fluid
                                specified by the manufacturer. If you notice any leaks or unusual fluid discoloration,
                                you should have
                                your
                                vehicle inspected by a professional.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Tire Maintenance</strong></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Proper tire maintenance is vital for optimal traction, handling, and
                                overall
                                safety.
                                Start by inspecting the tire pressure. Use a reliable tire pressure gauge to check the
                                pressure in all
                                four
                                tires, including the spare tire if applicable. Compare the pressure readings to the
                                recommended levels
                                specified in your vehicle&#39;s owner manual or the sticker typically located on the
                                driver&#39;s side
                                door
                                jamb. Inflate or deflate the tires as needed. Additionally, visually inspect the tires
                                for any signs of
                                damage, such as cuts, bulges, or punctures. Check the tread depth by using a tread depth
                                gauge or the
                                penny
                                test. Insert a penny into the tread groove with Lincoln&#39;s head facing down. If you
                                can see the top
                                of
                                Lincoln&#39;s head, it indicates that the tread has worn down and time to replace the
                                tires.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Brakes and Suspension</strong></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The braking system and suspension components are vital for your safety
                                and
                                control
                                while driving. Start by visually inspecting the brake pads through the wheels. Look for
                                any excessive
                                wear
                                or thinning of the brake pad material. If the brake pads wear out beyond a certain
                                threshold, you should
                                get
                                a replacement. Additionally, check the brake fluid level in the reservoir and ensure it
                                falls within the
                                recommended range. Pay attention to any signs of brake pedal pulsation or squealing, as
                                these may
                                indicate
                                the need for brake service. Regarding the suspension system, visually inspect the shocks
                                and struts for
                                any
                                signs of leaks or damage. If you notice excessive bouncing or a rough ride, it&#39;s
                                advisable to have
                                the
                                suspension components checked by a professional.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Lights and Signals</strong></span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Properly functioning lights and signals are essential for your visibility
                                and
                                communication with other road users. Regularly inspect all exterior lights, including
                                headlights,
                                taillights, brake lights, turn signals, and license plate lights. To test the lights,
                                turn on the
                                respective
                                switches and walk around the vehicle to verify their proper operation. If you notice any
                                burned-out
                                bulbs,
                                replace them promptly. It&#39;s also a good practice to clean the lenses regularly to
                                ensure maximum
                                brightness.</span></p>

                                        leaving areas uncleaned.
                                        If
                                        the blades are skipping, streaking, or not providing proper visibility, it&#39;s
                                        a clear indication

                                        they need to be replaced.</span></li>

                                recommended PSI (pounds per square inch). Inspect the tires for any signs of wear,
                                bulges, or cuts, and
                                ensure there is adequate tread depth. Bald or damaged tires can significantly affect
                                your vehicle&#39;s
                                handling and increase the risk of accidents. Additionally, rotate and balance the tires
                                as recommended
