        <hr>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sharing the road is a fundamental aspect of responsible and safe driving. In
                Texas, a
                state known for its vast road networks and diverse road users, it is crucial for motorists, cyclists,
                pedestrians, motorcyclists, and commercial vehicle operators to understand and respect each other&#39;s
                presence on the road. This module aims to provide a comprehensive guide to sharing the road in Texas,
                emphasizing the importance of cooperation, adherence to traffic laws, and promoting a culture of safety
                and
                respect.</span></p>

        <h2 class="c22" id="h.3c9z6hx"><span class="c10 c4">Understanding the Road Users</span></h2>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is crucial that in effectively sharing the road in Texas, you must have a
                comprehensive understanding of the various types of road users and their specific needs. Each category
                of
                road user presents unique challenges, but paying attention to vulnerable road users who require extra
                care
                and consideration is especially important. Let&#39;s delve deeper into each group.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Motorists</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Motorists are the most common road users, operating cars, trucks, and SUVs. They
                play
                a critical role in maintaining road safety and should be mindful of other users, particularly vulnerable
                road users. It is essential for motorists to remain alert and practice defensive driving techniques,
                including checking blind spots, signaling intentions, and adhering to speed limits.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Bicyclists</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bicyclists are among the vulnerable road users who require special attention from
                motorists. Motorists must respect the rights of cyclists and provide them with ample space to operate
                safely. When passing cyclists, motorists should allow a minimum passing distance of three feet, as
                mandated
                by Texas law. Additionally, motorists should avoid parking in designated bike lanes and use caution when
                opening car doors near bike lanes.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Pedestrians</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users and deserve extra attention and
                caution from motorists. Texas law grants pedestrians the right-of-way at crosswalks, even when they are
                not
                marked. Motorists must yield to pedestrians at intersections and exercise extreme caution when
                approaching
                areas with high pedestrian activity, such as school zones or shopping centers. For motorists,
                anticipating
                and respecting pedestrians&#39; presence is important, especially when making turns or entering/exiting
                driveways.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Motorcyclists:</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Motorcyclists, like bicyclists, are vulnerable road users due to their smaller
                size
                and lack of physical protection. Motorists should be particularly vigilant in watching for motorcycles
                and
                provide them with ample space on the road. Motorcyclists, on the other hand, should always wear
                protective
                gear, use their headlights during the day to enhance visibility, and avoid riding in a motorist&#39;s
                blind
                spot. Motorists should be cautious when changing lanes or making turns, as drivers may easily overlook
                motorcycles.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Commercial vehicles:</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Commercial vehicles, including trucks and buses, have unique characteristics that
                require careful consideration from all road users. These vehicles have larger blind spots and require
                more
                time to maneuver, particularly when making turns. Motorists should exercise extra caution when driving
                near
                commercial vehicles, providing them with extra space and allowing them adequate time to complete their
                maneuvers safely. Patience when sharing the road with commercial vehicles is important, so avoid sudden
                lane
                changes or aggressive driving behaviors.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Understanding the needs and characteristics of each road user, especially the
                vulnerable road users, promotes empathy, patience, and cooperation, leading to a safer road environment
                for
                all. By recognizing the diversity of road users and respecting their rights, we can foster a culture of
                inclusivity and promote harmony on Texas roads. Remember, whether you&#39;re a motorist, cyclist,
                pedestrian, motorcyclist, or commercial vehicle operator, we all share the responsibility to prioritize
                safety and respect when sharing the road, especially when interacting with vulnerable road users.</span>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sharing the road in Texas involves adhering to specific laws and regulations
                designed
                to promote safety and ensure smooth interactions between different road users. Familiarizing yourself
                with
                these laws and regulations is crucial for maintaining a harmonious and secure road environment.
                Let&#39;s
                explore some key laws and regulations related to sharing the road.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Traffic Laws</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Speed limits:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Observe and adhere
                to posted speed
                limits, as they are set to ensure safe driving conditions. Speeding not only endangers yourself but also
                puts other road users at risk.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Yielding right-of-way:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Understand and follow the
                rules of yielding right-of-way to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles when appropriate. Yielding
                is
                essential for preventing accidents and maintaining a cooperative flow of traffic.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Stop signs and traffic signals:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Come to a
                complete
                stop at stop signs and obey traffic signals to avoid collisions and maintain orderly traffic
                flow.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Lane usage:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Use designated lanes
                and follow lane
                markings appropriately. Changing lanes should be safely done and with proper signaling to indicate your
                intentions.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Passing and overtaking:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pass
                other vehicles
                safely
                and legally, adhering to the rules and regulations regarding passing zones and solid yellow lines.
                Always
                check blind spots and use turn signals when changing lanes or overtaking. Ensure there is sufficient
                distance and clear visibility to complete any maneuver without endangering yourself or other road users.
                You
                must not pass other vehicles in areas marked with solid yellow lines, where visibility is limited, or
                where
                signage indicates no-passing zones.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Vulnerable Road Users&#39; Rights</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Right-of-way for pedestrians:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Texas law grants
                pedestrians the right-of-way at crosswalks, even if they are not marked. Motorists must yield to
                pedestrians
                in crosswalks and exercise caution when approaching areas with high pedestrian activity.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Minimum passing distance for cyclists:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;When
                passing
                cyclists, Texas law requires motorists to provide a minimum passing distance of three feet. This ensures
                the
                safety and well-being of cyclists and helps prevent dangerous close calls or collisions.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Respect for motorcyclists:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Motorcyclists have the
                same rights and privileges as other motorists on the road. Give them ample space and always check blind
                spots before changing lanes or making turns.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c17" id="h.t0p48g2vngse"><span class="c24 c11 c4">Special Considerations</span></h3>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>School zones:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Observe reduced speed limits in school zones, usually marked with signs, and be
                alert
                for children crossing the road or boarding/exiting school buses.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Construction zones:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exercise caution and adhere to reduced speed limits in construction zones. Follow

                them to
                pass.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Railroad crossings:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Respect the warnings at railroad crossings, including flashing lights, barriers,
                and
                warning signs. Stop behind the marked lines when a train is approaching and only proceed once it is safe

                to
                the recommended three-second rule, which means you should have at least three seconds of distance
                between
                your vehicle and the one ahead. This provides you with enough time to react to sudden stops or changes
                in
                traffic.</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Check blind spots:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Before
                changing lanes or
                making
                turns, it&#39;s important to thoroughly check your mirrors and glance over your shoulder to ensure there
                are
                no vehicles in your blind spots. Blind spots are areas around your vehicle that cannot be directly
                observed
                through your mirrors. Taking the extra time to check your blind spots helps avoid collisions and ensures
                the

                and be aware of their presence. Bicycles have the same rights and responsibilities as other vehicles on
                the
                road, so following these tips for a safer and more harmonious experience is crucial.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Provide ample space</strong></span><span class="c0">: When passing a

                give
                them
                plenty of room to ensure their safety and avoid collisions. Maintain a distance of at least three feet
                between your vehicle and the cyclist when passing. If the road is narrow, be patient and wait for a safe
                opportunity to pass, taking into consideration the bicyclist&#39;s speed and any oncoming
                traffic.</span>

                than
                motor vehicles, especially on uphill climbs or in adverse weather conditions. Exercise patience when
                sharing
                the road with bicyclists, and avoid tailgating or pressuring them to go faster. Treat them as legitimate
                road users and wait for a safe and appropriate opportunity to pass.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Look for cyclists when turning</strong></span><span class="c0">:
                Before making
                turns,
                whether right or left, always check for cyclists in your blind spot. Bicycles can be less visible than
                larger vehicles, so take an extra moment to ensure that no cyclists are approaching from behind or in
                front
                of you. Use your turn signals early to communicate your intentions, giving bicyclists ample time to

                in
                Texas
                have designated bike lanes to provide a dedicated space for cyclists. Be mindful of these lanes and
                avoid
                encroaching on them with your vehicle. When parking, opening doors, or making right turns, always check
                for

                accidents. Motor vehicles, if not operated with caution, can cause extensive damage and even fatalities.
                Pedestrians have the right-of-way in designated areas, such as crosswalks and sidewalks, so be mindful
                of
                their presence and take the necessary precautions. Drivers should exercise caution when pedestrians are

        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Yield to pedestrians in crosswalks:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When approaching a crosswalk, always yield to pedestrians who are crossing or
                waiting
                to cross. Come to a complete stop if necessary and wait for them to reach the other side of the road
                safely.
                Be particularly cautious at intersections and unmarked crosswalks, as pedestrians may be crossing from
                unexpected locations.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>According to Texas law, pedestrians lawfully walking within any
                    marked or
                    unmarked crosswalk have the right-of-way over motor vehicles</strong></span><span class="c0">.
            </span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">This is particularly crucial for blind pedestrians using a walking stick or
                guide
                dog. </span></p>
        <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Even in the absence of defined crosswalks, drivers should be mindful of
                pedestrians
                waiting at street corners who may intend to cross the road. Vehicles should come to a stop before
                entering
                an intersection or reaching a marked white line that designates the beginning of a crosswalk. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Similarly, drivers must exercise extreme caution when reversing their vehicles,
                as a
                pedestrian may be walking behind and could be at risk of injury or being trapped under the vehicle. For
                drivers, it is essential to yield to pedestrians crossing the road, even if you have a green light and
                someone is crossing in front of you.</span></p>
        <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Observe reduced speed limits</strong></span><span class="c0">: In
                areas with
                heavy
                pedestrian traffic, such as school zones or residential neighborhoods, be aware of reduced speed limits
                and
                adhere to them. Slowing down means more time for you to react to any sudden movements or unpredictable
                behavior from pedestrians.</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Be cautious when turning</strong></span><span class="c0">: When making
                turns at
                intersections or driveways, pay close attention to pedestrians who may be crossing your intended path.
                Always use your turn signals to indicate your intentions, allowing pedestrians to anticipate your
                movements
                and adjust accordingly.</span></p>

                lots
                are common areas where pedestrians and vehicles interact closely. Take extra care when driving through
                parking lots, as pedestrians may appear suddenly from between parked cars or other obscured areas. Drive
                slowly, be patient, and always be prepared to yield to pedestrians.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Respect designated pedestrian zones:</strong></span><span

                aware of
                designated pedestrian zones, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, and shared-use paths. Avoid parking or
                driving
                in these areas, as they are for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. When parking, ensure that you
                do
                not block sidewalks or crosswalks, as it hinders the ability of pedestrians to navigate safely.</span>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Be attentive at night:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Pedestrians can be
                more
                difficult to see at night, so exercising extra caution when driving during low-light conditions is
                crucial.
                Ensure that your headlights are properly functioning and use them to illuminate the road ahead. Be
                particularly watchful in areas without streetlights or in residential neighborhoods where pedestrians
                may be
                present.</span></p>

        <p class="c12"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Pedestrian Activated Signals</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Many intersections and street crossings are equipped with pedestrian signals
                displaying the words &quot;WALK&quot; and &quot;DON&#39;T WALK.&quot; Other signals may feature a symbol
                of
                a walking person along with a raised hand directing pedestrians. </span></p>
        <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">At certain traffic signals, pedestrians may need to push a button to activate
                the
                &quot;WALK&quot; signal or the walking person symbol. It is the responsibility of drivers to adhere to
                pedestrian signals and yield the right-of-way to pedestrians.</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Give them space</strong></span><span class="c0">: Motorcycles require
                a smaller
                space
                to
                maneuver compared to larger vehicles. When passing a motorcyclist, provide ample space and keep a safe
                distance. Allow at least three to four seconds of following distance to ensure both your safety and
                theirs.</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Check blind spots:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Motorcycles
                can easily
                disappear
                in blind spots due to their smaller size. Always check your blind spots, especially before changing
                lanes or
                making turns. Use your mirrors effectively and physically turn your head to ensure there are no
                motorcyclists in your blind spots.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Use your turn signals:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Signaling

                common areas where accidents involving motorcycles occur. Take extra caution when approaching
                intersections
                and double-check for any motorcyclists before proceeding. Always yield the right-of-way when necessary,
                and
                be mindful of motorcyclists making left turns, as they may need to navigate wide turns due to their
                size.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Be mindful of road conditions:</strong> </span><span class="c0">Road

                impact
                your ability to notice and react to motorcyclists on the road. Put away your mobile devices, avoid
                eating or
                drinking while driving, and stay focused on the task of driving. Being attentive and alert will help you

        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sharing the road with commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, in Texas
                requires extra caution and awareness. These vehicles have different characteristics and limitations
                compared
                to passenger cars. </span></p>

        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here are some important tips for sharing the road with commercial
                vehicles.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Give them space:</strong></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Commercial
                vehicles,
                especially
                large trucks and buses, require more space to maneuver and have larger blind spots. When driving near a
                commercial vehicle, maintain a safe following distance to allow them ample room to stop or change lanes
                if
                needed. Avoid tailgating or cutting them off, as they require more time and distance to slow down or
                come to
                a complete stop.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Avoid their blind spots</strong></span></strong><span class="c0">:
                Commercial
                vehicles
                have
                significant blind spots, also known as &quot;no-zones,&quot; on all sides of the vehicle. These blind
                spots
                include the areas directly behind the vehicle, the areas on either side just behind the cab, and a wide
                area
                on the passenger side. Stay out of these blind spots to ensure that the driver can see you. If you
                can&#39;t
                see the driver&#39;s mirrors, assume that they can&#39;t see you either.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Use caution when passing</strong></span><span class="c0">: When
                passing a
                commercial
                vehicle, signal your intentions early, and check for any oncoming traffic. Pass quickly but safely,
                ensuring
                that you have enough room to merge back into the lane without cutting off the commercial vehicle.
                Maintain a
                consistent speed and avoid lingering alongside a commercial vehicle, as it may be difficult for the
                driver
                to see you or merge if necessary.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Be patient during turns</strong></span><span class="c0">: Commercial
                vehicles
                often
                need
                extra space to make turns due to their size and length. Be patient and give them ample room when they
                are
                making turns, especially right turns. Avoid trying to squeeze between a turning commercial vehicle and
                the
                curb, as it can lead to a collision or damage to both vehicles.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c4 c<strong>7">Anticipate wide turns</span><span class="c0">: Commercial vehicles,
                especially
                trucks with trailers, require a wider turning radius. Be aware of this and give them plenty of space
                when
                they are making turns. Never try to pass a turning commercial vehicle on the right side, as they may
                need to
                swing wide to the left to complete the turn.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Be cautious when merging:</strong></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Commercial
                vehicles
                take
                longer to accelerate and may require more space to merge onto the highway. Be courteous and give them
                the
                space they need to merge safely. If you see a commercial vehicle signaling to merge, adjust your speed
                or
                change lanes if possible to accommodate their entry onto the highway.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Watch for wide load and oversize signs</strong></span><span
                class="c0">: Some
                commercial
                vehicles may be transporting wide or oversized loads. Keep an eye out for warning signs indicating these
                special loads, and give them extra space and caution. These vehicles may require more room to navigate
                through narrow areas or obstacles.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></span><span class="c0">: Avoid
                distractions while
                driving
                especially when sharing the road with commercial vehicles. Distractions can make it harder to notice
                important cues or changes in traffic patterns. Put away your mobile devices, avoid eating or drinking,
                and
                keep your focus on the road and your surroundings.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember, practicing patience, maintaining awareness, and observing traffic laws
                are

                Vehicles</span></h3>
        <p class="c28"><span class="c0">Drivers of law enforcement and emergency vehicles are also road users who use
                the

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="c28 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c28"><span class="c0">If you are near an intersection, finish crossing the intersection before pulling

        <h2 class="c22" id="h.65s3ucvpuyav"><span class="c10 c4">Special Considerations</span></h2>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While sharing the road, there are certain situations and road users that require
                extra attention and consideration. Being aware of these help create a safer and more inclusive road
                environment. Below are some important factors to keep in mind.</span></p>
        <h3 class="c17" id="h.1j4nfs6"><span class="c24 c11 c4">School Zones</span></h3>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In areas where schools are located, school crossings are marked to indicate the
                presence of school children along the roadway. When a person is in the crosswalk, drivers must come to a
                complete stop, allowing them to pass before proceeding. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overtaking other vehicles is not permitted, even if they are driving slower than
                your
                vehicle. Adjust the speed of your vehicle according to the vehicle in front of you. </span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In some cases, special guards may be present to ensure the proper use of the
                crossing
                by school children, and drivers are obligated to comply with their instructions. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">These guidelines are in place to safeguard children from the dangers of traffic
                accidents. Speeding in a school zone is a serious traffic violation that can have severe consequences
                for
                all parties involved. </span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4"><strong>Texas law strictly enforces a speed limit of 20 mph in school zones,
                    which
                    drivers
                    must not exceed under any circumstances. However, specific speed limits may vary depending on the
                    local
                    jurisdiction.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="c12 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c12"><span class="c0">So, when you are in a school zone, you should take note of these safety
                reminders.</span></p>
